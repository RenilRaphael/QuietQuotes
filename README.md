# QuietQuotes
Simple python "widget" to show quotes on the desktop.  
The font style, size and colour can be customized. Font may not be visible if u have a wallpaper thats white, so do change the colour. At this point in time, i have not implemented feature to autodetect.
To run QuietQuotes on startup (FOR WINDOWS, as of now i have not tested on any linux system):  
  Meet the requirements from requirements.txt.  
  Save main.py as main.pyw, then create a shortcut to main.pyw.  
  Move the shortcut to the Startup folder. (Win+R, then type "shell:startup" and then enter)  
  Run the startup.
